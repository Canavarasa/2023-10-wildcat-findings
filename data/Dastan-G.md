To ensure that transfers in the WildcatMarketToken contract do not result in zero amounts for the scaledAmount value.

```solidity
if (scaledAmount == 0) {
      revert NullTransferAmount();
    }
```

### Should be:
```solidity
// Check if the scaledAmount value is greater than zero.
    require(scaledAmount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

With this verification, the _transfer function will only proceed with the transfer if the scaledAmount value is greater than zero, ensuring that transfers do not result in zero amounts.
