In the WildcatMarketController contract, you have a function called `deployMarket`. Within this function, you use the `_tmpMarketParameters` variable, which appears to be of type `TmpMarketParameterStorage`. It's initially set with the `parameters` variable, and then after some deployment code, you call `_resetTmpMarketParameters()` to reset `_tmpMarketParameters` to its initial state.

This pattern of setting `_tmpMarketParameters`, using it for the deployment, and then resetting it is used to store temporary parameters for the market you're deploying. However, it's not necessary to reset the parameters at the end of the function because this function's scope is limited to this specific deployment operation.

// Local variable 'parameters' to store the market parameters
    TmpMarketParameterStorage memory parameters = TmpMarketParameterStorage({
        asset: asset,
        namePrefix: namePrefix,
        symbolPrefix: symbolPrefix,
        feeRecipient: address(0),
        maxTotalSupply: maxTotalSupply,
        protocolFeeBips: 0,
        annualInterestBips: annualInterestBips,
        delinquencyFeeBips: delinquencyFeeBips,
        withdrawalBatchDuration: withdrawalBatchDuration,
        reserveRatioBips: reserveRatioBips,
        delinquencyGracePeriod: delinquencyGracePeriod
    });

    address originationFeeAsset;
    uint80 originationFeeAmount;
    (
        parameters.feeRecipient,
        originationFeeAsset,
        originationFeeAmount,
        parameters.protocolFeeBips
    ) = controllerFactory.getProtocolFeeConfiguration();

    // Do not reset '_tmpMarketParameters', since 'parameters' is local
    // and will be automatically cleaned up when this function finishes


Instead of reusing `_tmpMarketParameters`, you create a new local variable `parameters` of type `TmpMarketParameterStorage` within the function `deployMarket`. This variable is used to store the parameters for this specific market deployment, and it's initialized with the required values. Because it's a local variable, it will automatically go out of scope and be cleaned up after the function execution.

The key point here is that since `_tmpMarketParameters` is used only within the `deployMarket` function and is not needed after the function finishes executing, there's no need to explicitly reset it. You can create a new variable (`parameters`) for each deployment, and it will be automatically cleaned up, making the code more concise and avoiding any unintended state changes.

This change simplifies the code and helps avoid any potential issues related to resetting parameters or unintentional interference between deployments. It's a good practice in Solidity to limit the scope of variables to where they are actually needed to reduce complexity and potential bugs.
