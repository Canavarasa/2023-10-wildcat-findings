### Penalty APR Mechanism
Penalty APR is meant to punish borrowers who do not meet the reserve requirements. The reserve requirement has a rolling grace period. Once penalty APR start to apply to a market, there is likely going to be a huge decrease in the confidence in the borrower ever paying back the loan, and every lenders will likely to keep requesting withdrawal, until the borrower either pay back and close the market OR just simply default and not pay back. This seems quite drastic and seems to hinges on the one single instance where the penalty APR starts applying. This is like a step function. 

A design where the penalty APR is scaled linearly when the reserve is not met slightly all the way to there is zero reserve may be able to keep every lenders panic withdrawing and also for borrowers to have some choices/time to react. But this will add on to the complexity of the system. In this case, the penalty APR is scaled in a linear function to the how little reserve is left.

It depends on what is the intended effect of applying the penalty APR. Is it meant to be a huge red flag that signals bankrun panic to everybody? Or is it going to be a slight nudging all the way to a full blown panic when there is absolutely nothing left in the market for withdrawal?
