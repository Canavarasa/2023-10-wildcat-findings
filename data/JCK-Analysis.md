## Phase 1: Documentation and Video Review

A: Start with a comprehensive review of all documentation related to the The Wildcat Protocol platform, including the whitepaper, API documentation, developer guides, user guides, and any other available resources.

B: Watch any available walkthrough videos to gain a holistic understanding of the system. Pay close attention to any details about the platformâ€™s architecture, operation, and possible edge cases.

C: Note down any potential areas of concern or unclear aspects for further investigation.


## Phase 2: Manual Code Inspection

I: Once familiarized with the operation of the platform, start the process of manual code inspection.

II: Review the codebase section by section, starting with the core smart contract logic. Pay particular attention to areas related to WildcatMarketController,WildcatSanctionsEscrow,WildcatSanctionsSentinel,WildcatMarket and WildcatMarketWithdrawals contracts 

III: Look for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow/underflow, improper error handling, etc., while also ensuring the code conforms to best programming practices.

IV: Document any concerns or potential issues identified during this stage.


## Phase 3: Architecture recommendations:
   
   1. WildcatMarketController:
   Market Queries: The contract provides functions to query information about controlled markets. It allows checking if a market is controlled by this contract and retrieving the list of controlled markets.
   Market Deployment: This is a crucial part of the contract. It allows the deployment of Wildcat markets with specific parameters. Some important aspects of market deployment include:
   Validation of market parameters based on constraints.
   Calculation of a unique address for each market based on asset, name prefix, and symbol prefix.
   Checking whether a market with the same parameters has already been deployed, and if so, reverting to prevent duplicate deployments.
   Updating lender authorization for the new market.
   Parameter Constraints: The contract enforces constraints on various market parameters, ensuring they are within allowable ranges. This is important for maintaining the stability and security of the system.
   Temporary Reserve Ratio: The contract introduces a mechanism to temporarily modify the reserve ratio when changing the annual interest rate. This temporary reserve ratio change lasts for two weeks. This is a risk management feature.
   Error Handling: The contract uses custom error messages and error selectors to provide clear and informative error messages when functions fail. This is good for debugging and user experience.
   Comments and Documentation: The code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of functions and modifiers. This enhances code readability and helps developers understand the contract's logic.

   2. WildcatSanctionsEscrow:
   The code to be designed for managing sanctions-related escrowed assets. Ensure that the integration with the Chainalysis sanctions list is properly handled and tested in a real-world scenario.
   While the code is commented, it might be helpful to add additional comments explaining the purpose of certain checks and conditions to improve code readability.
   Error Handling: The contract uses the revert statement with custom error messages (e.g., CanNotReleaseEscrow()) to provide meaningful error messages when the release conditions are not met. This is important for clarity and user experience.
   Balance Function: The balance function returns the current balance of the escrow contract in terms of the specified asset.
   Can Release Escrow Function: The canReleaseEscrow function checks whether the funds held in escrow can be released. It does so by checking if the borrower's account is not sanctioned. If the account is not sanctioned, the escrow can be released.
   Escrowed Asset Function: The escrowedAsset function returns a tuple containing the asset's address and the balance held in escrow.

   3. WildcatSanctionsSentinel:
   The code is part of a broader system dealing with sanctions and escrows. Ensure that the interactions with Chainalysis and other components are well-implemented and tested.
   The contract's ability to override sanctions is a powerful feature. Ensure that appropriate access control and security measures are in place to prevent misuse.
   createEscrow: This function creates a new WildcatSanctionsEscrow contract for a specified borrower, account, and asset. It checks if the caller is a registered market and adds the escrow contract to the set of sanction override addresses for the borrower.
   isSanctioned: This function checks if an account is sanctioned based on the Chainalysis sanctions list and if the sanction has not been overridden by the borrower. The logic ensures that the borrower cannot override a valid Chainalysis sanction.

   4. WildcatMarket:
   The contract is part of a more extensive financial market system. Ensure that the interactions between this contract and others in the system are well-documented and thoroughly tested.
   Consider using interfaces or abstract contracts for the inherited contracts to ensure consistency and to make it easier to upgrade the system.
   depositUpTo: This function allows users to deposit up to a specified amount of underlying assets into the market and mint market tokens. It handles the scaling of the mint amount and ensures the market's maximum deposit is not exceeded. It's essential for users to enter the market.
   updateState: This function updates the market state by applying pending interest, delinquency fees, protocol fees, and processing pending withdrawal batches. It's a critical function for the contract's operation.

   5. WildcatMarketWithdrawals:
   The code is well-structured, but it is crucial to ensure that the dependencies, especially the "IWildcatSanctionsSentinel" contract, are reliable and decentralized to mitigate centralization and systemic risks.

## Phase 4: Codebase quality analysis:
  
   1. WildcatMarketController:
   The code have good quality. It follows best practices for code organization, access control, and error handling. The use of struct data types and modifiers improves code readability and maintainability.

   2. WildcatSanctionsEscrow:
   The code is concise and straightforward, focusing on its specific purpose of holding and releasing assets based on sanctions-related conditions. It adheres to the specified interface and uses proper error handling.


## Phase 5: Centralization risks:

 the Wildcat Protocol aims to provide decentralized and autonomous credit agreements. However, it also highlights that lenders collateralize their own loans, which might introduce centralization risks if a small number of lenders dominate the protocol. Further assessment of centralization risks would require real-world usage data and a code review.
   
   1. WildcatMarketController:
   The contract is to rely on an external entity, the borrower, to perform certain actions. Depending on how this borrower address is controlled, there may be centralization risks. If the borrower can act maliciously or is compromised, it could impact the system.

   2. WildcatSanctionsEscrow:
   The contract relies on an external entity, the sentinel, to provide parameters like the borrower and account. Depending on how the sentinel is controlled, there may be centralization risks associated with it.

   3. WildcatMarketWithdrawals:
   Centralization Risks: The contract interacts with the "IWildcatSanctionsSentinel" contract to check if an account is sanctioned and, if so, transfers funds to an escrow. The centralization risk arises if the "IWildcatSanctionsSentinel" contract is not adequately decentralized or can be manipulated.


## Phase 7: Mechanism Review:

   1. WildcatMarketController:
   The code implements a mechanism for deploying and managing markets. It enforces constraints on market parameters and temporarily adjusts the reserve ratio when changing the annual interest rate. These mechanisms are designed for maintaining the stability and security of the system.
   
   2. WildcatSanctionsEscrow:
   The mechanism implemented in the contract appears to be sound, ensuring that funds are held in escrow until specific conditions are met, primarily related to the borrower's account's sanction status.

   3. WildcatSanctionsSentinel:
   The mechanisms implemented in this contract appear to function as intended. They allow borrowers to override sanctions and deploy escrow contracts, which is likely a critical part of the system.

   4. WildcatMarket:
   The mechanisms in the contract seem to work as intended. It handles deposits, borrowing, fee collection, and closing the market. Careful consideration should be given to each function's logic and potential impact on the market state.


## Phase 8: Systemic Risks:

The protocol the absence of underwriters and insurance funds, which introduces systemic risks as the protocol does not have mechanisms to mitigate losses in case of defaults or unforeseen events. These systemic risks should be carefully considered by potential users and lenders and evaluated in the code.
1.  WildcatMarketWithdrawals:
If the central system (contracts the "WildcatMarket" relies on) is compromised or manipulated, it may result in systemic risks for the Wildcat markets and their users.
