[L-1] the setup of keeping 90% reserveRatio during a rate reduction makes the protocol not usable for market that has an above 90% reserveRatio in the beginning.

if a market has >90% reserve ratio as a base line, then the borrower can take advantage of the rate reduction to lower the reserve ratio to 90%. This basically gives the borrower advantage. Even though a market of 90%+ reserve ratio is unlikely to be popular, this is still an edge case that becomes MEV for users who is unaware of this limitation.

## Recommendation
explicitly disable creation of market, that has >=90% reserve ratio, instead of 100%.
