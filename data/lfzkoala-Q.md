## Issue 1
Location: src/WildcatMarketController.sol
The contract uses `revert` for error handling, but it would be more user-friendly to use require statements with meaningful error messages. It's better to use `require` statements with clear error messages to provide better feedback to users. e.g., 
```
require(msg.sender == borrower, "Caller is not the borrower");
```
## Issue 2
Location: src/WildcatMarketController.sol
There are two `getControlledMarkets` with different inputs. It's better to rename one of them to distinguish different functions.

## Issue 3:
Location: src/WildcatMarketController.sol
The enforceParameterConstraints function performs some parameter checks, but it's crucial to validate input parameters in all external and public functions to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. I'd recommend adding input validation on the parameters such as `namePrefix` and `symbolPrefix` on their length. 

## Issue 4:
Location: src/WildcatArchController.sol
The contract lacks a mechanism for upgradeability, which means that once deployed, it cannot be changed or upgraded. In the event of a bug or the need for an upgrade, this could pose a problem. I'd recommend considering implementing an upgradeable contract pattern, such as the Proxy pattern with an upgradeable logic contract, to allow for future upgrades and bug fixes without migrating data or user balances.

## Issue 5:
Location: src/market/WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol
In the function `executeWithdrawal` there is no input validation for the address `accountAddress`.

## Issue 6:
Location: src/market/WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol

The return type of the executeWithdrawal function is inconsistent. In particular, the return type should be uint256 but the returned variable `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` is of type uint128. Also, the author could directly return `normalizedAmountWithdrawn` when defining the function. 
```
unction executeWithdrawal(
    address accountAddress,
    uint32 expiry
  ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 normalizedAmountWithdrawn) {
```
## Issue 7
Location: src/market/WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol
In the `processUnpaidWithdrawalBatch` function there is no check on the `expiry` value and doesn't revert if it's empty, which makes it vulnerable to DoS attack. 

## Issue 8
In the `calculateLinearInterestFromBips` function, an unchecked block is used, which disables overflow/underflow checks in the most recent solidity version. More details see https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1717123449850634543 (Also some other functions are using unchecked blocks)

Location:
function calculateLinearInterestFromBips(
  uint256 rateBip,
  uint256 timeDelta
) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
  unchecked {
    return accumulatedInterestRay / SECONDS_IN_365_DAYS;
  }
}

Manage overflows and underflows correctly, ensuring mathematical operations are safe.

## Issue 9
Location: src/libraries/FeeMath.sol	
Duplicated `calculateLinearInterestFromBips` function as in the MathUtils.sol file. 

## Issue 10
Location: src/libraries/StringQuery.sol	
In the `queryStringOrBytes32AsString` function and `queryName` function, there is no input validation on the address `target`. Should check the `target` address is non-zero. 

## Issue 11
Location: src/market/WildcatMarket.sol
In the `closeMarkets` function it's better to follow the Check-Effect-Interaction pattern. That is, update the internal state before performing external asset transfers. That is,
```
...
_writeState(state);
if (currentlyHeld < totalDebts) {
      // Transfer remaining debts from borrower
      asset.safeTransferFrom(borrower, address(this), totalDebts - currentlyHeld);
    } else if (currentlyHeld > totalDebts) {
      // Transfer excess assets to borrower
      asset.safeTransfer(borrower, currentlyHeld - totalDebts);
    }
```

## Issue 12
Location: src/market/WildcatMarketToken.sol
In the `_transfer` function it seems we donâ€™t need to write state because this function doesn't actually change the state actually. It just fetches some value from the state and calculates new account balances.
