# My Day 1 auditing Wildcat Protocol:

First thing first, I have opened up the codebase trying to fit my eyes into it check every function and trying to understand what the code really means, afterwards I have ended up reading the Whitepaper of the project.

# Day 2

After, gaining confidence and information of reading the Whitepaper I had then a new look on the codebase, really started to understand how the functions work and what they are trying to achieve. 

Later that day, Started reading the Documentation about the project, which was really well written and informative.

# Day 3 

After reading the Documentation carefully, I've started feeling really into the code and started creating Diagrams of how the different contracts connects to each other and what functions are they taking from external ones.

Gained some more knowledge, and started leaving notes on the functions that I lack information on so I can later investigate how the things work up there.

# Day 4

 After 5 hours of reading the code and at the same time the documentation, I have finally understood the whole protocol. And started looking for vulnerabilities. Leaving notes on the functions that I was sure there is an issue.

# Day 5

I have started to connect the issues, and started creating diagrams for them.

# Day 6 

Found a gas optimisation that I have submitted straight away.

# Day 7

Testing Time! 
I have started testing all the vulnerabilities that I have found by this moment, trying to see how the attack might work and is it really that big of a deal.

# Day 8

Started submitting all the issues that I was sure about and was carefully tested in foundry.

# Day 9

I have made a final look out on the code to check if I have missed something.

***I might say thank you Wildcat Team for providing me this opportunity to have a look on your job and even find some vulnerabilities :)***

# Recommendations
As a recommendation, I would say that you might try and decrease the volume of the codebase as there are lots of contracts and lots of connections which may lead to a confusion.

Another recommendation might be to use more interfaces provided by Open Zeppelin. As they have been proven to be one of the best.

On another note, good job guys! I am wishing you all the luck for the future and congratulations!
